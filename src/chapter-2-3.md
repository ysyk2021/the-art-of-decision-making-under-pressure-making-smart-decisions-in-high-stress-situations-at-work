Emotions play a significant role in decision-making under pressure. When individuals are under stress, their emotions can impact their ability to make rational decisions. Fear, anxiety, and anger can cause individuals to make impulsive decisions or avoid making decisions altogether.

How Emotions Can Bias Decision-Making

Managing emotions is essential to making smart decisions under pressure. Leaders must develop strategies for managing their emotions, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness practices. They should also take breaks when needed to clear their minds and reduce stress.

Self-awareness is critical to managing emotions in decision-making under pressure. Leaders must be aware of their emotional triggers and recognize when they are feeling overwhelmed or stressed. They should also be mindful of their body language and tone of voice when communicating with others.
