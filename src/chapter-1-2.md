Decision-making under pressure has evolved over time with the development of decision-making theory and practice. In this chapter, we will explore historical perspectives on decision-making and how it has influenced today's approach to decision-making under pressure.

Early Perspectives on Decision-Making
-------------------------------------

Early perspectives on decision-making focused on rationality and logic. This approach assumed that individuals had access to complete information and could make decisions based solely on this information. However, this perspective did not account for the impact of emotions or incomplete information on decision-making.

Behavioral Decision-Making
--------------------------

Behavioral decision-making emerged in the mid-20th century and challenged the rationality and logic approach. This approach suggested that decision-making was influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, and heuristics. It also recognized the importance of incomplete information in decision-making.

Contemporary Approaches to Decision-Making
------------------------------------------

Contemporary approaches to decision-making under pressure build on the behavioral decision-making approach and recognize the importance of emotions, incomplete information, and time constraints. They focus on developing a decision-making framework that considers all relevant factors and criteria. This approach also emphasizes the importance of managing emotions and practicing mindfulness to stay focused and rational in high-stress situations.

The Impact of Technology on Decision-Making
-------------------------------------------

The advent of technology has revolutionized decision-making under pressure. Access to real-time data and advanced analytics has enabled decision-makers to make more informed and data-driven decisions quickly. However, it also presents challenges such as information overload and reliance on technology.

In conclusion, historical perspectives on decision-making have influenced today's approach to decision-making under pressure. By understanding these perspectives, leaders can develop strategies that consider all relevant factors, manage emotions, and incorporate technology effectively.
